  <li>a.i. The point of this program is to allow users to store their diets within their name; they can store diets by naming them and inputting the macros and the ntoes of the diet.</li>
</ol>

<p>a.ii. The program prompts the user to enter a username which will be called to the backend to load any diets if there are any. Then, a user is able to input any diets by inputting the name and the specific macros which gets saved to the sql lite database. They are also able to toggle between diets where they can edit or remove the diets as well.</p>

<p>a.iii. There are 6 inputs: Dietname, Calories, Fat, Protein, Carbs, and Extra Notes. These inputs are signified by the submit button. Users can also click delete diet if they select on a diet thats already stored in the database to remove it.</p>

<p>iii.
The name of the variable representing the collection type is “self”” is what populates the collection type through an SQLite Database.</p>

<p>iv. The data that my list contains is extremely vital to my program since it contains every single unique attribute about the diets for each persons entry. This is absolutely vital to the program as it is able to fetch and store the recieved diet macros in order to populate the tables for when the user searches up their name and pick their specific diets.</p>

<p>v.
Without the variable “self”, everything will become inefficient as the program would then require some sort of individual variable for each and every unique attribute. This would unneedingly lengthen my code and make it much too bulky and complex.</p>
