<p>License Communities, License Types Guide
Q1,When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.
A1
Software licenses and options are agreements between the software creator and the user that dictate how the software can be used, distributed, and modified. The most common types of software licenses MIT, GNU, Etc. With an MIT one must credit your work if they wish to look at it, for a GNU all you information is free to everyone.
Q2, In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
A2
Software licenses and options are agreements between the software creator and the user that dictate how the software can be used, distributed, and modified.</p>

<p>Digital rights refer to the rights of individuals and companies to control the distribution and use of their digital content, including music, videos, software, and other digital media. This often involves the use of digital rights management (DRM) technologies to restrict unauthorized copying and sharing of the content.</p>

<p>In terms of legal and ethical considerations, it is important to respect the terms of software licenses and to properly attribute the creators of digital content. Failure to do so can result in legal action and damage to one’s reputation. Additionally, the use of DRM technologies to restrict the rights of consumers has been a controversial issue, with some arguing that it unfairly limits their ability to use and enjoy the content they have purchased.</p>

<p>When it comes to personal analysis, it is important to consider one’s own values and beliefs when making decisions about software licenses and digital rights. Some may prioritize the freedom to modify and share software, while others may value the protection of intellectual property rights. It is also important to consider the impact of these decisions on the broader society and the technology industry as a whole.</p>

<p>5.6 Safe Computing
Q1, Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
A1;
Some Personal Identifiable Information that I have seen on github is names, birthdays, and grade.</p>

<p>Q2, What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
A2;
It’s a little weird seeing that anyone can access personal information on me, but Im just not going to give them a reason to.</p>

<p>Q3, Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
A3;
A good Password is something that is long, contains numbers and special keys and is not related to you at all. Bad would be Vice. Another step that can be used in authentication is 2 factor authentication, maybe sending you an email.</p>

<p>Q4, Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
A4;
Symmetric encryption, also known as shared secret encryption, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. In other words, the sender and the recipient of the encrypted message both have access to the same secret key and use it to encrypt and decrypt the message. Symmetric encryption is fast and efficient, but it has a major drawback: the key must be securely shared between the sender and the recipient, which can be a challenge in practice.</p>

<p>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses two different keys for encryption and decryption: a public key, which is used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption. The public key can be freely shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret. The recipient of the encrypted message uses their private key to decrypt the message, while the sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt it. Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption because it eliminates the need to securely share a secret key. However, it is also slower and more computationally expensive.</p>

<p>Q5, Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
A5;
In AWS deployment we used Asymmetric encryption.</p>

<p>Q6, Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
A6;
I haven’t really “learned the hard way” to my knowledge. However just recently my brother got identity fraud from someone posing as our personal bank, he got $6,000 dollars taken from him.</p>
