<p>This was an extreemely interesting experience for me, I spent around 45 minutes presenting my project and looking around at other projects from Mr. Yueng and Mr. Mortensen’s students. I saw very many creative and sophisticated ideas, I really did enjoy socializing and trying out other peoples’ projects. 
I will be blogging 4 different projects that I took pictures and were very intrigued to.</p>

<h1 id="project-1">Project #1:</h1>
<p>This project is a GPA calculator for IVY league schools. You enter your unweighted GPA, Essay Score, extra cirriculars, leadership positions, awards, and an optional ACT or SAT score. The API with the stored data for the colleges uses the user input values to calculate chances of getting into all IVY league schools. The frontened is very nice and the backend does work however there is one flaw that we noticed. Mr. Mortensen put in a 2.9 unweighted GPA and regular activities and he had a 30 percent chance of getting into Brown University thus showing flaws in the calculation process. Lastly, something I found cool was that the language could be changed as well.</p>

<h1 id="project-2">Project #2:</h1>
<p>This project was a kahoot called Codehoots. The frontened is remoled and it runs like a single player trivia game. The frontened was beautifully built, very easy to figure out and user friendly. The look itself waas extreemely intriguing. What I found cool is that they were able to implement a time feature and a skip feature that would make the player lose points if any were exceeded. The backened is mainly composed of the data for the questions. This project went way over the top and I enjoyed this alot. Maybe they could have had better questions rather than just code :)</p>

<h1 id="project-3">Project #3:</h1>
<p>This project was a remake of the classic game Pong and there was also a Blackjack game incorporated as well. The Pong game was multiplayer and you could play again your friends which I found was very clever and very sophisticated as they had to get to seperate inputs. The game also ran pretty smoothly and there weren’t issues. This same goes with the Blackjack game however I didn’t explore that very much because I don’t enjoy Blackjack. The interface to the whole fastpage and all the games was very well built and I especially foudn the Pong court really cool.</p>

<h1 id="our-project">Our Project:</h1>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functioning the way we wanted the project to</li>
  <li>Have a decently good looking frontened</li>
  <li>Runs smoothly without issues</li>
  <li>Incorporates the unique feature of search bar</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Couldn’t connect frontend and backend so the links are embeded in the frontend</li>
  <li>The project is a bit more simple than other projects</li>
  <li>Some of the CSS could be better and more creative</li>
  <li>Project overall was rushed</li>
</ul>

<p>Our project was rushed due to personal reasons within the group and poor decision making. We had to make this project in the last 48 hours and we came up with this. This is an NBA statistic website where you can click and search up any team for tons of data about them. Our goal is to try to make it so we can connect the frontend and backend rather than having to use embded links.</p>
