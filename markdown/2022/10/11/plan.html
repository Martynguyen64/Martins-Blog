<h1 id="overview">
<a class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>
<p>Our game is a jeapordy and we have 7 questions per section. The sections are math, Comp Sci, Literature, Sports, Ireland, Video Games, and Science. We want to replicate this like a typical jeapordy game, whoever answers the question right gets to choose a section, if they get it wrong they lose points etc. We also are trying to incorporate external factors that impact score such as speed and answer streak.</p>

<h1 id="program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose and Function:</h1>
<p>The purpose of our Jeopardy spin-off project is mostly for entertainment. As for input or output, we could make the questions and have the user input the answers, then depending on whether the question was answered correctly along with other parameters (possibly time or an answer streak), the output is the given answer, whether it was correct or incorrect, the correct answer (if incorrect), and points. The way this would function is it would store the inputted answer into a variable and compare it to a variable where the correct answer is stored
 # Data Abstraction: 
 A list will be used to store the possible categories of questions and/or the buttons to the corresponding questions. This is given that we plan on making more question categories than will be displayed in each game. A list will also be used for the questions and the possible correct answers.
    - A question list will be made in the following manner:
    -QuestionList = [{“category”: “general”, “question”: “Zoophobia is the fear of <strong>__</strong>”, “answer”: “Animals”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “Pierre Augustine Caron de Baumarchais play what Opera based on it”, “answer”: “Barber Of Seville”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “Hang on Sloopy’ was the official rock song of which band”, “answer”: “Ohio”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “When is turkey traditionally eaten in america”, “answer”: “Thanksgiving”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “What was mozart’s first name”, “answer”: “Wolfgang”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “In the film ‘titanic’, who did leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet play”, “answer”: “Jack”},
    {“category”: “general”, “question”: “What was founded in the UK 1694 because of war with France”, “answer”: “Bank Of England”}]</p>
<h1 id="managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Complexity:</h1>
<p>Given the number of questions and number of correct answers (including potential alternates such as 4 and four and Four), configuring variables for each question and each answer is possible but impractical. Perhaps we could</p>
<h1 id="procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Procedural Abstraction:</h1>
<p>A function will be developed with the forementioned loop in (5). Other than the loop, it will display the categories on the top row of the table of questions and put the contents of the questions on separate screens which will be accessed when the question’s corresponding buttons are pressed.</p>
<h1 id="algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm Implementation:</h1>
<p>A loop will be used to cycle each category, and the access method to each question so that the question can be displayed when a corresponding space in a table is clicked.</p>
<h1 id="testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing:</h1>
<p>The first call of the function would be to populate the table of questions on the main page with access methods to the questions. The second call will populate the separate screens with the questions. In addition, there will also be print() statements in the code (ex: print which categories of questions were selected for the game, which question was selected, etc.) in case of bugs</p>
