<p>Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale University who believes that the idea of stratergies humans needed to implement in order to maintain happy lifestyles.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#stratergy-1-we-control-our-well---being" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stratergy 1: We control our well - being</h1>
<p>There is a common misconception that we are stuck in the current well-being we are in, but that is false. We are able to improve our happiness ourselves. From a study by Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist, found that about 50% of our well-being is affected by our genes. This means that the other 50% can be affected by our own doing.</p>

<p>Taking control of your flow of life is the hardest part of becoming happy. Just learning about psychology won’t help you become happy, you must put it into practice. For example to become fit, one must workout regularly and consistently to observe results. Same with your well-being, one must make a change that is consistently affecting your life for the better.</p>

<p>Nick Eppley and his colleagues at Chicago Business School conducted a study asking people on the subway to stay in a solitary state, a state where one must talk to another the whole ride, or do what ever they want. According to the study, the people who made social connections felt happier than before and those who were solitary felt worse.</p>

<p>Taking time to be thankful about something everyday can improve one’s happiness. Just writing a small note about what you are grateful for can bump up your happiness and well-being. It keeps your mind on positivity instead of negativity and it is good for your well-being.</p>

<p>Taking time to realize what you are doing and focusing is important for your well-being. People tend to just go through the motions and rush through the day trying to get everything done, but taking a moment to really comprehend what is going on in your day can bump up your well-being.</p>
