<ul>
<li>Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles:<ul>
<li>Bits: the smallest unit of data in a computer, used to represent a boolean value</li>
<li>Bytes: unit of data that is typically made up of 8 bits, used to represent a single character or symbol in a computer’s memory</li>
<li>Hexadecimal: a numeral system that uses base 16, used in computing as a way to represent binary data in a more compact and human-readable form</li>
<li>Nibbles: a unit of data that is made up of 4 bits, used to represent a single hexadecimal digit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point:<ul>
<li>Unsigned Integer: a positive whole number that can range from 0 to infinity that is determined by the number of bits used to represent the integer</li>
<li>Signed Integer: can represent both positive and negative whole numbers</li>
<li>Floating Point: a data type that represents a decimal number</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB:<ul>
<li>Boolean: a data type that has only two possible values, true or false</li>
<li>ASCII: a standardized character encoding that represents letters, numbers, and other symbols in computers; represent text in computers</li>
<li>Unicode: a standardized character encoding that represents most of the world’s written languages; includes ASCII and many other characters from different scripts and languages</li>
<li>RGB: a color model used to represent colors in devices; combination of these three colors in different proportions creates a wide range of colors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless:<ul>
<li>Lossy: involves discarding some of the data in the original file in order to reduce its size; used for audio, video, and image files, where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for a smaller file size</li>
<li>Lossless: involves encoding the data in such a way that all of the original information can be recovered when the file is decompressed; used for text, software, and other types of data where it is important to preserve all of the original information</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators:<ul>
<li>Variables: used to store and manipulate data in a program</li>
<li>Data Types: classification of data based on the type of value it can hold; include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings</li>
<li>Assignment Operators: a symbol that is used to assign a value to a variable (=)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class:<ul>
<li>Lists: an ordered collection of items with square brackets ([])</li>
<li>2D Lists: also called a matrix, a list of lists</li>
<li>Dictionaries: collection of key-value pairs, uses curly braces ({})</li>
<li>Class: a blueprint for creating objects, they have member variables and have behavior associated with them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration:<ul>
<li>Algorithms: a set of steps or instructions that are followed to solve a problem or perform a task</li>
<li>Sequences: executes a series of steps in a specific order</li>
<li>Selection: executes one or more steps based on a specific condition</li>
<li>Iteration: executes one or more steps repeatedly until a certain condition is met</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expressions, Comparison Operators, Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables:<ul>
<li>Expressions: combination of values, variables, and operators that results in a single value</li>
<li>Comparison Operators: compare values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other</li>
<li>Boolean Expressions and Selection: a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (if statements)</li>
<li>Boolean Expressions and Iteration: iteration (while loops) can use a boolean variable as a condition(if statements)</li>
<li>Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings:<ul>
<li>Characters: a single letter, number, symbol, or other element</li>
<li>Strings: sequence of characters</li>
<li>Length: number of characters it contains</li>
<li>Concatenation: combining two or more strings into a single string</li>
<li>Upper: convert a string to all uppercase</li>
<li>Lower: convert a string to all lowercase</li>
<li>Traversing Strings: to access each character in the string one by one, use a for loop to do this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements:<ul>
<li>Python If: execute a block of code if a specific condition is true</li>
<li>Elif: to specify additional conditions to check if the previous conditions are false</li>
<li>Else conditionals: execute a block of code if all of the previous conditions are false</li>
<li>Nested Selection Statements: control structures that contain other control structures within them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Python For, While loops with Range, with List:<ul>
<li>Python For: used to execute a block of code multiple times</li>
<li>While loops with Range: execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue:<ul>
<li>Combining loops with conditionals to Break: break is used to exit a loop early</li>
<li>Continue: used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values:<ul>
<li>Procedural Abstraction: abstract away the details of how the task is performed, making your code easier to read and maintain, more efficient code</li>
<li>Python Def procedures: how procedures are made with the def word</li>
<li>Parameters: values that are passed to the procedure when it is called, defined within the parentheses of the procedure definition</li>
<li>Return Values: value that is returned can be used by the calling code to perform additional tasks or to assign to a variable</li>
</ul>
</li>
