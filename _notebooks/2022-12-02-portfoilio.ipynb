    "# Variables, Assignments, Data Abstraction\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- Abstraction insde a program that can hold a value\n",
    "- Organizes data with a name\n",
    "- Consist of name, value, type\n",
    "- Understanding of code is through name of variables\n",
    "- Types of data:\n",
    "    - Interger, String, Boolean\n",
    "    - List can also be stored in variables \n",
    "        - Print/retreive specific values\n",
    "        - easily able to add and remove values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignments\n",
    "- Assignment operator allows program to change value represented by variable\n",
    "    - =, +=, -=, *=, /=, **=\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Abstraction\n",
    "- Method used in coding to usefully represent data\n",
    "- Variables and list are primary tools\n",
    "- Provides seperation btw abstract properties of a data type and concrete details of its representation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithms\n",
    "- Sequencing\n",
    "    - Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification.\n",
    "- Selection\n",
    "    -  Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision.\n",
    "- Iteration\n",
    "    - If a condition is true, then the code can repeat.\n",
    "- Flowcharts\n",
    "    - Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm.\n",
    "- Pseudocode\n",
    "    - A blend of human language and coding format.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arithmetic Operation\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages.\n",
    "- subtraction (-)\n",
    "- addition (+)\n",
    "- multiplication (*)\n",
    "- division (/)\n",
    "- Getting the remainder (%)\n",
    "- ORDER OF OPERATIONS is crucial\n",
    "    - reassigning variables using operations on other variables can get confusing\n",
    "- PAY ATTENTION TO SEQUENCING SO OPERATIONS OF VARIABLES DONT GET MESSED UP\n",
    "- Track varaibles (common question in AP Exam)\n",
    "\n",
    "# String\n",
    "- A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc.\n",
    "- len () : to find the length of a string\n",
    "- lower () : to convert to lowercase\n",
    "- concat (): in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lists and Iteration\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "- Sequence of variables\n",
    "    - Used to store multiple items in a variable\n",
    "    - ordered and flexibe\n",
    "- Tuple: collection thats ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates\n",
    "- Set: Unordered, unchangeable, doesn't allow duplicates\n",
    "- Dictionary: ordered, changeable, doesn't allow duplicates\n",
    "- Index: refrences an element in a list that is in order\n",
    "- Elements: values in the list that are assigned to an index\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "    - append() adds elements\n",
    "    - index() returns the index of the first element with specificed value\n",
    "    - inset() adds element at given position\n",
    "    - remove() removes the first item with the specified value\n",
    "    - reverse() reverse list order\n",
    "    - sort() sorts the list\n",
    "    - count() returns amount of elements with specified value\n",
    "    - copy() returns a copy of the list\n",
    "    - clear() removes elements from list\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration\n",
    "- repetition of a process applied to the result or taken frmo previous statement\n",
    "    - for loops\n",
    "    - while loops\n",
    "- 2 types of iteration: indefinite and definite\n",
    "    - definite: clarifies how many times the loop is going to run\n",
    "    - indefinite: how many times its going be ran based on conditions\n",
    "- When object is iterable it can be used in an interation \n",
    "- Iter() returns an interator\n",
    "- Strings, list, dictionaries, sets, and tuples are iterable objects\n",
    "- Break: stops the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2D Iteration\n",
    "- Lists of lists\n",
    "- Read in 2 dimensions (list on top of list\n"
