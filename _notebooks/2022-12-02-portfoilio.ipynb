    "- Abstraction insde a program that can hold a value\n",
    "- Organizes data with a name\n",
    "- Consist of name, value, type\n",
    "- Understanding of code is through name of variables\n",
    "- Types of data:\n",
    "    - Interger, String, Boolean\n",
    "    - List can also be stored in variables \n",
    "        - Print/retreive specific values\n",
    "        - easily able to add and remove values\n",

    "- Method used in coding to usefully represent data\n",
    "- Variables and list are primary tools\n",
    "- Provides seperation btw abstract properties of a data type and concrete details of its representation\n",

    "# Algorithms\n",
    "- Sequencing\n",
    "    - Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification.\n",
    "- Selection\n",
    "    -  Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision.\n",
    "- Iteration\n",
    "    - If a condition is true, then the code can repeat.\n",
    "- Flowcharts\n",
