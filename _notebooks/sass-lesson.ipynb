    "# Why SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS, which means that Sass will translate the Sass code you wrote into CSS, which is what your web browser can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SASS vs SCSS\n",
    "As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used."

    "A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this [one](https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the repository, head over to `assets/css/`, and open `style.scss`.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting in CSP (Content Security Policy) refers to the ability to specify a policy for a specific resource or set of resources that are loaded within another resource. For example, if you have an iframe on your website that loads content from another domain, you can use CSP to restrict the types of content that can be loaded within that iframe. This is done by specifying a policy for the parent resource (your website) that applies to any nested resources (the content loaded in the iframe).\n",
