    "3 | 0 |the data and code that was atempted to be written was not able to be simplified without it being complex as they could have used conditionals |They didnt give a point as the data could have been used within a list and conditional|\n",
    "4 |0| only one parameter set which didnt serve purpose for code which didnt meet requirements for as it was stated to move the process smoothly  |No point was given as it didnt have peramaters and funcitionaly through the code|\n",

    "3 | 1 | It used the game for the user to guess the word and kept a data storage which made it simple|It was given a 1 since they used to guess word to the user which kept everything simpler|\n",
    "4 |1 | Guess word parameter was usen giving it a 1  | College board gave the point due to the fact the program was developed accurate and purposeful with the many parameters leaving the user to guess the word|\n",
    "5 |1 |Repeated loop with replace list meeting the criteria. Also used booleans to check true or false in order to keep word accuracy |College board gave the 1 due to the fact the loops and many parameters implemented a lot of algorithms with accuracy|\n",
    "6 |1| The word guessser was very good and all part were correct| College Board also gave this person a 1 as the testing works and the application is valid.|\n"
