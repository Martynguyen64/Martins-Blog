    "As shown in the above image, I earned a 3/3 (100%) on the Data Compression quiz, which indicates that I have a very good understanding of what we learned this week. Generally speaking, as I was completing this quiz, I really had no trouble answering any of the questions and none of them really forced me to think for a while before arriving at the correct answer. While it is great I earned a good score on this mini quiz, it is also important that I refer back to this quiz along with many of the other tests and quizzes that we have taken on College Board, as all of these will definitely serve as useful study tools for the AP exam. It is also important that I continue to practice more on questions like the one on this quiz, as one quiz may not always be enough to indicate that I am strong in answering these kinds of questions. Overall, I am very happy with my score and believe that this quiz will be useful in helping me study for the AP exam coming up.\n",

    "        - Smaller file size while still maximizing its original quality\n",
    "    - Disadvantages\n",
    "        - While lossless data compression reduces the file size, it only does so slightly, meaning that it takes up more space\n",

    "- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Where have you been a consumer of buffering?\n",
    "I have been a consumer of buffering when it comes to transferring pictures from my camera and uploading them on to my Google Photos account. Buffering involves temporarily storiing data as one moves it from one place to another, so in that sense, the images that I want added to my Google Photos serve as the data being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering?\n",
    "With buffering, I have been able to retain the original resolution of the desired images while still moving the image data from one place to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do these effects apply to images?\n",
    "In my experience, I have used buffers to change some attributes of the image, such as the size and scale, the format, the file type (png, jpg, heic, etc.) and many more. While I do end up getting the desired product, whether it was changing the size or file type, I have found that it can sometimes reduce the quality of the image slightly and make the image look a little \"off\" from the original. On the surface, it may not look like anything has changed, but when you look closely, one can begin to clearly notice the differences.\n",

    "grey scale question\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed?\n",
    "Yes, this code definitely acts as a series of steps being performed, as there are several functions and procedures tat go into making the image tinted grey.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images?\n",
    "The scale for each image changes depending on what it was initially, For example, originally, the green square image was smaller, but using the scale function, it was made much larger. With the scale for the second image, there was no visible change (may have been made slightly larger), however, for the third image (largest image), the image was shrunk down a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code?\n",
    "(1) Import the necessary libraries, such as PIL, base64, and numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Create a list of images that you would like to make grey (or whatever the desired color is)\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Create functions that will resize/rescale the image however you want it (shrink it, enlarge it, keep it the same, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Convert the images into base64\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Create the function that will play the main role of tinting the images grey\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) For every pixel in the image, if the length of the pixel list is greater than 3, then the grey data will be appended and will be updated accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Print both the original image and the grey image with the different size, scale, etc. so that the user can see what changed between the two\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described?\n",
    "Yes, scale image is a type of compression in that it is a lossless data compression. Lossless data compression involves resizing the images into a smaller version, which aligns with how you can scale the image in order to make it smaller while still retaining its data and resolution."
