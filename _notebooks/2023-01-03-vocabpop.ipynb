    "# Unit 2 Binary/Data Terms\n",
    "- Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles:\n",
    "    - Bits: the smallest unit of data in a computer, used to represent a boolean value\n",
    "    - Bytes: unit of data that is typically made up of 8 bits, used to represent a single character or symbol in a computer’s memory\n",
    "    - Hexadecimal: a numeral system that uses base 16, used in computing as a way to represent binary data in a more compact and human-readable form\n",
    "    - Nibbles: a unit of data that is made up of 4 bits, used to represent a single hexadecimal digit\n",
    "- Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point:\n",
    "    - Unsigned Integer: a positive whole number that can range from 0 to infinity that is determined by the number of bits used to represent the integer\n",
    "    - Signed Integer: can represent both positive and negative whole numbers\n",
    "    - Floating Point: a data type that represents a decimal number\n",
    "- Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB:\n",
    "    - Boolean: a data type that has only two possible values, true or false\n",
    "    - ASCII: a standardized character encoding that represents letters, numbers, and other symbols in computers; represent text in computers\n",
    "    - Unicode: a standardized character encoding that represents most of the world’s written languages; includes ASCII and many other characters from different scripts and languages\n",
    "    - RGB: a color model used to represent colors in devices; combination of these three colors in different proportions creates a wide range of colors\n",
    "- Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless:\n",
    "    - Lossy: involves discarding some of the data in the original file in order to reduce its size; used for audio, video, and image files, where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for a smaller file size\n",
    "    - Lossless: involves encoding the data in such a way that all of the original information can be recovered when the file is decompressed; used for text, software, and other types of data where it is important to preserve all of the original information"

    "- Expressions, Comparison Operators, Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables:\n",
    "    - Expressions: combination of values, variables, and operators that results in a single value\n",
    "    - Comparison Operators: compare values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other\n",
    "    - Boolean Expressions and Selection: a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (if statements)\n",
    "    - Boolean Expressions and Iteration: iteration (while loops) can use a boolean variable as a condition(if statements)\n",
    "    - Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator\n",

    "    - Lower: convert a string to all lowercase\n",
    "    - Traversing Strings: to access each character in the string one by one, use a for loop to do this\n",
    "- Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements:\n",
    "    - Python If: execute a block of code if a specific condition is true\n",
    "    - Elif: to specify additional conditions to check if the previous conditions are false\n",
    "    - Else conditionals: execute a block of code if all of the previous conditions are false\n",
    "    - Nested Selection Statements: control structures that contain other control structures within them\n",
    "- Python For, While loops with Range, with List:\n",
    "    - Python For: used to execute a block of code multiple times\n",
