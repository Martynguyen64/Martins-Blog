# Why I think the Lakers are the Best NBA Team:

The Lakers might have had a bad last season, however they will be the best NBA team heading into the 2022 - 2023 season. 
They have the greatest player of all time Lebron James and they had the best center in the league of Anthony Davis whos super versatile. 
They also have Westbrook who is without a doubt the most explosive pointguard in the leage.
Watch out for the Los Angelos Lakers !!! :O
