Natural Selection

  - > Differential Repoductive Success is natural selection

  - > If you have a higher fitness level, higher survivability
    
      - > Higher fitness pass on genes, lower fitness die

  - > Evolution creates new alleials

  - > Gene pool is a combination of all genes in population

  - > Mutation and reproduction create variety
    
      - > Adaptation is from these two

  - > Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
    
      - > 1848
        
          - > p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = l
        
          - > DD Dd dd
        
          - > q^2 = .98
            
              - > Q = .99
    
      - > 1895
        
          - > q^2 = .05
            
              - > Q = .22

  - > Adaptation Process
    
      - > Adapt to environment through natural selection to exploit niches
    
      - > They work their way up the ecosystem
    
      - > Species are created as traits are formed from adaptions to the enviroment
