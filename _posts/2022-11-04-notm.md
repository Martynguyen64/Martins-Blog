# Overview
This was an extreemely interesting experience for me, I spent around 45 minutes presenting my project and looking around at other projects from Mr. Yueng and Mr. Mortensen's students. I saw very many creative and sophisticated ideas, I really did enjoy socializing and trying out other peoples' projects. 
I will be blogging 4 different projects that I took pictures and were very intrigued to.

# Project #1:
This project is a GPA calculator for IVY league schools. You enter your unweighted GPA, Essay Score, extra cirriculars, leadership positions, awards, and an optional ACT or SAT score. The API with the stored data for the colleges uses the user input values to calculate chances of getting into all IVY league schools. The frontened is very nice and the backend does work however there is one flaw that we noticed. Mr. Mortensen put in a 2.9 unweighted GPA and regular activities and he had a 30 percent chance of getting into Brown University thus showing flaws in the calculation process. Lastly, something I found cool was that the language could be changed as well.
