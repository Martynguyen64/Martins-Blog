# Learning Objectives

 1. Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration

 2. Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration

 3. Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people

## General Notes

1. E.g. Facebook: People are responsible for different things and have to work together to figure out whats best for the public
2. Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it
3. Computing innovations can be physical and non physical

2. Tanabe was level designer, Miyamoto was director
3. Collaboration between the two was able to make a good game including both of their talents and perspectives

## How to collaborate in class

1. Pair Programming
    1. Two Programmers work together as a pair. One writes the program while the other obeserves and navigates (reviews code as its typped in)

2. Think - Pair- Share
    1. Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas and they form a result to share with class

3. Collaboration tools:
    1. repl.it
    2. Github
    3. Shared document or folder
    4. Use peers to test and give feedback on code

# Leave comments in code!

1. Communicate to your partner(s)
2. Communicate to yourself
3. Acknowledge code segments 
used from other sources
4. Acknowledge media used from other sources
5. Differentiate what you and your partners did
6. Clarify functionality of your code

# Hacks
1. My group is set up on common intrest between my gruop memebers. All my gruop memebers including me are willing todo whatever it takes to succeed in the class which I believe will drive us to maek good projects.
2. We all have different perspectives regarding creativity and different work ethics which I believe combining all of them can lead to a more divese project with good variety.
3. Yes we are equipped, we all have a good understanding of the class and aren't behind, we all also have a passion for coding and are determined todo whatever it takes to get a good grade.
