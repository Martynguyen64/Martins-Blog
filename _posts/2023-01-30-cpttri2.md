# Martys Feature CPT
My feature is the main feature where the user is able to input statistics (macros) of their diet. The given macros they are supposed to input are calories, carbs, sugars, protein, and fat. Bassicly, the user will be able to input, edit, or delete their data regarding their diet anytime and the data will be saved to their account. The goal is that they will always be able to view their macros of their diet whenever they log in. We plan on doing this by taking the inputs and save them to a row of the database. The inputs will be saved to a certain row of their databse based on what account they are on (the row/area of the database is created when an account is created). 
## CRUD Features
    1. C: Occurs when a person signs up/creates an account and they can add on by implementing their fitness data
    2. R: The Information
    3. U: Any User
    4. D: Any User

| Reporting Category | Criteria | How I will Fit Criteria |
|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | ✅ describes the overall purpose of the program demonstrated in the video ✅ describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video ✅ describes the input and output of the program | The purpose of the program is to allow the user to input their macros into the database and that will allow them to organize and keep their diet in one page under an account where they can always view. |
| Data Abstraction | ✅ one program code that shows how data has been stored in this list (or another collection type). ✅ one program code that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. ✅ identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. ✅ describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program | Our program abstracts data through data implementation which is accessed in a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store information about the macros to a users diet. These values represent an useable application where users can store and view details and inputs. | 
| Managing Complexity | ✅ includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program  ✅ explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. | Without |
| Procedural Abstraction | ✅ one program code showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure ✅ one program code showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. ✅ describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program | All of this data is being abstracted from outside REST API's. I will create procedures that will go through the list of cities to output results of the user input city. |
| Algorithm Implementation | ✅ includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration ✅ explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it | The code would include selection by choosing the city within the huge list of cities in San Diego County. And to actually select this city, the code will have to iterate through the list which is held in alphabetical order. |
| Testing | ✅ describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. ✅ describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. ✅ identifies the result of each call | The different arguments will be the different locations that I decide to test in the video. I will show the different results of each call, so the weather and how far the location is from my location will be the results.  |
