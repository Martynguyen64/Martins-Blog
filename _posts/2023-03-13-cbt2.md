# What I got Wrong
## Question 10
I got question 10 wrong: Personal cybersecurity risks. It asks which of these situations is the greatest risk to cybersecurity. I read the question as LEAST greatest risk to cybersecurity causing me to pick B. This answer was paying a bill to a secure electronic payment system. The correct answer is C which is emailing a credit card number to a hotel. This is not secure at all becuase the people could use your information.

## Question 12
I got this question wrong because I thought that it was asking which one would indicate a phishing attack, rather than which one was least likely. Option A would be the correct answer because an email from your bank to confirm a transaction would be safer.

## Question 29
I got question 29 wrong. This question was asking about a code segment and if the code segment displays a certain text. I did not understand this question very well. I put answer C which said true false true. I put this because the variables a, b, and c were defined as such. I did not understand what the code after that did so I thought it was meant just to throw me off. The correct answer is false, false, false. This is because the two code statments changed variables a and c. The a was changed to false because b was true thus not b is false. The statement then is false. The next one defines c as false because a is now defined as false making c false. If I got the correct answer on the fourth line of code I would have got it correct.

## Question 31
I got this one wrong because I did not thoroughly read through the algorithm and the gate would open outside of business hours. Option D is correct because the gate would not open outside of business hours and the gate would open correctly.

## Question 40
I got this one wrong because interchanging the rotate_right and rotate_left blocks would push the robot off the grid. There would be no change needed in this algorithm.

## Question 41
I got this question wrong because the list has to be sorted in order of value in order to use a binary search algorithm. So, converting binary to decimal numbers is not necessary.

## Question 50
I got question 50 wrong. It was asking about the run time of four different algoritms. I put algorithms A and C when the correct answer was A and D. I put C because it increases by multipling by n. This seemed efficiant to me because there was one calculation. however the correct answer was d because it squares n and this shortens it by using polynomial efficiantcy.
