# What I got Wrong
## Question 21

This problem is wrong because I chose C instead of D. If I sort by C, this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1 making it wrong. Option D is the correct one instead because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest which we can then fliter by year which will remove any entries with unknown years. Lastly, filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers.
