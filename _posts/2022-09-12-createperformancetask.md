# Ideas I have in mind:
1. GPA Calculator
2. Fantasy Basketball team developer

# Program Purpose and Function
I need to show a program that takes an input and uses that input to produce an output. I need to be able to describe in words wht the program is trying to achieve, how the program functions, and describe what the input and output are in the program. I am currently able to do these things because I can take a user's input to output a result.

# Data Abstraction
I need to create a data structure that can store data and use that data structure in a function. I need to identify the variable of the list and describe what the list's data is used for in the program. I am able to do this with the positioning of the tiles in the AppLab. The data in the list is used to position the tiles on the x and y coordinates.

# Managing Complexity
I need to utilize a list to reduce redundancy of a program. I can do this by using the list in a for loop and completing a function for each part of the list until the list is fully used.

# Procedural Abstraction
I need to create a function that receives a parameter that can affect the result of the function. I can do this by creating a function that receives user inputs as a function and compiles into a numeric or string result.

# Algorithm Implementation
I need to use sequencing, selection, and iteration. I am not sure how to use sequencing and selection and I can learn through College Board or Khan Academy. However, I do know how to use iteration by using loops.

# Testing
I need to test two different parameters into the function created before by calling the function. I can do this by inputting different responses when taking user input.

# What I plan todo to make myself prepared:
Khan Academy will be my best friend for me to learn and review concepts. I then will use collegebaord and provided thigns by the teacher to practice and develop my skills. However, the number thing about coding is self exploration, I need to play around with code and try to code things for fun on my own rather than just meeting the requirements.
