# Questions I got Wrong

## Question #32
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Q32.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

I put A instead of B by accident. I initially thought B was the right answer but I just clicekd the wrong one. 
A is wrong because This option is incorrect. The current score in a game is likely to change often (statement II). Option B is correct because This option is correct. A constant is a good choice for statement I and statement III because the value of pi and the number of days in a standard calendar week never change.
