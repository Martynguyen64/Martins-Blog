The given macros they are supposed to input are calories, carbs, sugars, protein, and fat. Bassicly, the user will be able to input, edit, or delete their data regarding their diet anytime and the data will be saved to their account. The goal is that they will always be able to view their macros of their diet whenever they log in. We plan on doing this by taking the inputs and save them to a row of the database. The inputs will be saved to a certain row of their databse based on what account they are on (the row/area of the database is created when an account is created). CRUD Features 1. C: Occurs when a person signs up/creates an account and they can add on by implementing their fitness data 2. R: The Information 3. U: Any User 4. D: Any User]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Collegeboard MCQ Test 2 Reflection</title><link href="https://martynguyen64.github.io/Martins-Blog/markdown/2023/01/30/cb2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collegeboard MCQ Test 2 Reflection" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://martynguyen64.github.io/Martins-Blog/markdown/2023/01/30/cb2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I got Wrong Question 13: The “AND” operator returns true only if both of its arguments are true. I initially thought option III was correct, but later realized option II was the correct answer. This is because if option I were true, it would mean that a student wouldn’t be able to vote at age 18 due to the use of the less than or equal to sign. Option II is correct because it states that a person who is 16 or older can drive, but cannot vote until they are 18 or older. Therefore, option II and III, which is the opposite of II, are correct answers. This is because while a person in the desired age range can be exactly 16, they cannot be exactly 18 or they will be allowed to vote.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Chapter 7 Bio Notes</title><link href="https://martynguyen64.github.io/Martins-Blog/2023/01/30/Chapter-7-bio-notes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 7 Bio Notes" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://martynguyen64.github.io/Martins-Blog/2023/01/30/Chapter-7-bio-notes</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natural Selection]]></summary></entry></feed>
