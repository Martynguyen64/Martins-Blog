The given macros they are supposed to input are calories, carbs, sugars, protein, and fat.

The goal is that they will always be able to view their macros of their diet whenever they log in. We plan on doing this by taking the inputs and save them to a row of the database. The inputs will be saved to a certain row of their databse based on what account they are on (the row/area of the database is created when an account is created). CRUD Features 1.
